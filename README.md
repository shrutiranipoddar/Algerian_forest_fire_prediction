# 🔥 Algerian Forest Fire - Temperature Prediction using Ridge Regression

This project uses **Ridge Regression**, a regularized linear regression technique, to predict the **temperature** in Algerian forest regions. Accurate temperature prediction is important for anticipating wildfire risks and enabling early fire management.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Forest fires are a major environmental hazard in Algeria, especially during summer. Understanding how weather variables influence temperature can help prevent catastrophic events.

This project builds a **regression model** to predict **temperature** using multiple environmental and meteorological features from two Algerian regions: Bejaia and Sidi-Bel Abbes.

## 🧠 ML Approach

### ✅ Model Used
- **Ridge Regression** (Linear regression with L2 regularization)

### ⚙️ Preprocessing
- **StandardScaler** from `sklearn.preprocessing` was used to normalize features.

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
